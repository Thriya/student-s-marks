# Student Grades Calculator

This Python program calculates a student's grade based on their marks in three subjects. The grade is determined by the average of the three marks, and the grading system follows these rules:

- **Grade A**: Average ≥ 90
- **Grade B**: 80 ≤ Average < 90
- **Grade C**: 70 ≤ Average < 80
- **Grade Fail**: Average < 70

## Features
- Simple and easy-to-use program.
- Accepts marks for three subjects as input.
- Outputs the calculated grade based on the average.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
2. Download or copy the program code into a `.py` file (e.g., `grades_calculator.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python grades_calculator.py
